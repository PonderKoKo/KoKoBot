# KoKoBot
This is the repository for the Discord Bot KoKoBot, written in JavaScript and intended to be run on node.js.
I'm already hosting the bot, so if you only want to use it in your server, just add it with https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=720678773317435553&scope=bot&permissions=0, provided you are an Administrator in the server.
As of right now, the bot has three main features: Automatically Posting Spoilers, Generating Virtual Booster Packs and hosting threecardmagic tournaments.
